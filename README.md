Welcome to the FLAMES single sample tutorial!

In this tutorial, we will guide you through a basic analysis of long-read single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our goal is to demonstrate how to use the output from our package, FLAMES, to create and process long-read single-cell data. Here we will focus on using Seurat and other very popular single cell tools for analysis and processing single cell data. Much of this analysis will follow standard short read single cell processing norms, yet with long read data we can also explore isoform-level expression in single cells. This can be very useful as we hope to demonstrate throughout this tutorial.
